Python code to analyze NFL plays from spatiotemporal data

# Background

This project is yet another implementation of Bornn and Fernandez's landmark
[Wide Open Spaces](https://static.capabiliaserver.com/frontend/clients/barca/wp_prod/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Wide-Open-Spaces.pdf) paper.

The primary source of inspiration for the project is from Matthew Chang's
[Uncovering Missed Tackle Opportunities](https://github.com/mpchang/uncovering-missed-tackle-opportunities/)
repo, specifically the spatial.py file. Much of "my" code in this repository
is quite blatantly stolen.

Other sources of inspiration are:

 * [jmlee8939's Pitch Control Model](https://github.com/jmlee8939/Wide-Open-Space_Pitch_Control_Model)
 * [andrewyyip's Pitch Control Model](https://www.kaggle.com/code/andrewyyip/pitch-control-model)
 * [Between the Lines](https://github.com/danielhocevar/BigDataBowl2023)

# Data

This project utilizes data from the [Big Data Bowl 2024](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/nfl-big-data-bowl-2024/data).
